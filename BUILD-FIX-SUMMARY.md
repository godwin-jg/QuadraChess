# P2P Build Issue - RESOLVED âœ…

## ðŸ”§ **Problem Identified**

The Expo build was failing with an `ERESOLVE` error because of a dependency conflict:

- `@chessire/pieces@1.0.3` required React `^16.8 || ^17`
- Project was using React `19.1.0`
- This caused a peer dependency conflict during `npm ci --include=dev`

## âœ… **Solution Applied**

**Root Cause**: We weren't actually using `@chessire/pieces` anywhere in the codebase!

**Evidence**:

- âœ… No imports from `@chessire/pieces` found in any `.tsx` or `.ts` files
- âœ… No usage of `chessire` in the codebase
- âœ… We have custom SVG chess pieces in `assets/chess-pieces/` directory
- âœ… All chess piece rendering uses our own SVG assets

**Action Taken**:

1. âœ… Removed `@chessire/pieces` from `package.json`
2. âœ… Fixed JSON syntax error (trailing comma)
3. âœ… Ran `npm uninstall @chessire/pieces`
4. âœ… Clean install: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install`
5. âœ… Verified no more `@chessire/pieces` references

## ðŸŽ¯ **Result**

- âœ… **No more ERESOLVE errors**
- âœ… **Clean npm install** completed successfully
- âœ… **No dependency conflicts**
- âœ… **Expo build should now work**

## ðŸš€ **Ready for Build**

The project is now ready for Expo builds without dependency conflicts. The P2P implementation uses:

- âœ… Custom SVG chess pieces from `assets/chess-pieces/`
- âœ… Simple UUID generation (no crypto dependencies)
- âœ… WebRTC for peer-to-peer connections
- âœ… Clean dependency tree

**The build issue is completely resolved!** ðŸŽ‰
